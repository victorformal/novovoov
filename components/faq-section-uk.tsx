  {
    q: "Does it really stick to curved walls or columns?",
    a: "Yes, that's its main design feature. The 5mm acoustic felt backing allows flexibility down to a 20cm radius. Customers have installed it on 18cm diameter columns and arches. Photos available in the reviews below.",
  },
  {
    q: "What do I need to install it? Do I need a tradesman?",
    a: "A utility knife and a ruler. That's it. The adhesive is pre-applied and repositionable for 48 hours. 94% of our customers install it themselves, with no prior renovation experience. Average time: 25 minutes per panel.",
  },
  {
    q: "What if I order too many panels?",
    a: "Returns are free within 30 days for uncut panels. Our calculator includes a 10% margin for waste. You can also order the exact minimum and come back to top up if needed.",
  },
  {
    q: "Is it real wood or a plastic coating?",
    a: "Real wood. The slats are solid MDF with genuine wood finish. You can sand and stain it like any wood. No PVC film, no paper veneer.",
  },
  {
    q: "Will it hold up in damp rooms (bathroom, kitchen)?",
    a: "Yes, for normal use. Several customers have installed it in bathrooms and above worktops. Just avoid direct running water or steam exposure.",
  },
  {
    q: "When will I receive my order?",
    a: "Dispatch within 24-48 hours, delivery in 5-8 working days to mainland UK. You'll receive a tracking email as soon as it ships. Delivery is free on all orders.",
